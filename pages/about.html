<h2> My Early Years </h2>

I grew up in Singapore - one of the freest economies of the world - 
whereby the government formulates a national plan and market forces are allowed to operate within these pre-defined limits.
I did considerably well in Singapore's educational system, despite spending much of my time representing my school in sports - namely Soccer and Badminton. 
Our country educational system ranks at the top OECD's program for international student assessment
though singapore's schools have long held a reputation for didactic teaching, rote learning and academic brillance over social skills, health and overall happiness.
I recall tutoring a small group of studensts years ago, many of them didn’t know how to deal with disagreements and they would shout because they didn’t know any better.
Singapore has since then shifted its emphasis away from grades, 
and provided space for students to re-discover the joy of learning and experience a more holistic development.

<h2> My Beliefs </h2>

I'm strong believer in "If you want something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done." 
Following your passion is just not enough, one must be willing to do what it takes to become great at it.
Most people will also be passionate about lots of things over the course of their life. 
It’s normal to care about many different things. It’s OK, and completely normal. 
Following your passion is also a very "me" centered view of the world. when you go through life, 
it is better to follow your contributions. Find the things you are good at or want to be good at, put in the hours to make it great and 
share that with the world. Contribute to others 
and make the world a better place. On that road, you’ll develop that passion you are now trying to find amidst the rubble of conflicting priorities.
You may also want to assemble a trustworthy team to complement one another strengths and weaknesses. 
There is this saying "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together" or as Jim Collins put it "First who, then what". 
Get the right people on the bus first, before deciding where to drive. When facing uncertainty, you cannot possibly predict what is coming up around the corner
and the best strategy is to have a busload of amazing people who can adapt to and perform brillantly no matter what comes in the way.

<h2> My Vision </h2>
What do you do when no one believes in you? 
</br>
You believe in yourself.
</br>
I don't know how many times I have been tested with this question. I was wrote off, looked down, and labelled as unrealistic.
I wake up every morning and confront the hard truth that nobody knows or understands where I'm going except me. 
And it's on me, and only me, to get there. Once you start achieving things and proving people wrong,
the hardest lesson you'll have to learn is to not walk around with a chip on your shoulder.
Accomplishing something on your own is the easy part. The hard part is sharing the prize with all the people (especially those closest to you — family, friends, etc.) 
that didn't believe in you when you needed it most or had constantly dismissed you and your aspirations.
That's when you begin to accept and understand that sometimes nobody sees your vision except you.

 What do you when no one believes in you?
 </br>
 You believe in yourself.
 </br>
Not Everyone Is Meant To See Your Vision.
