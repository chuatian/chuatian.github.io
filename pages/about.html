<h2> My Early Years </h2>

I grew up in Singapore - one of the freest economies of the world - 
whereby the government formulates a national plan and market forces are allowed to operate within these pre-defined limits.
I did considerably well in Singapore's educational system, despite spending much of my time representing my school in sports - namely Soccer and Badminton. 
Our country educational system ranks at the top OECD's program for international student assessment
though singapore's schools have long held a reputation for didactic teaching, rote learning and academic brillance over social skills, health and overall happiness.
Singapore has since then shifted its emphasis away from grades, 
and provided space for students to re-discover the joy of learning and experience a more holistic development.

<h2> My Beliefs </h2>

I'm strong believer in "If you want something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done." 
Following your passion is just not enough, one must be willing to do what it takes to become great at it.
Most people will also be passionate about lots of things over the course of their life. 
It’s normal to care about many different things. That's okay. 
Following your passion is also a very "me" centered view of the world. When I go through life, 
I follow my contributions and ride every opportunity that comes along the way. 
Discovering the things I'm good at or want to be good at or need to be good at, put in the hours to make it great and 
share that with the world when given the opportunity. Contribute to others 
and make the world a better place. On that road, I've developed a passion to learn - mainly Business, Computer science, Engineering, Law - amidst the rubble of conflicting priorities.
During the early days of my start-up, I have also assembled a trustworthy team to complement my strengths and weaknesses. 
There is a saying "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together" or as Jim Collins put it "First who, then what". 
Get the right people on the bus first, before deciding where to drive. When faced with uncertainty, it's impossible to predict accurately
 what is coming up around the corner
and the best strategy is to have a busload of amazing people who can adapt to and perform brillantly no matter what comes in the way.

<h2> My Vision and Perseverance </h2>
What do you do when no one believes in you? 
</br>
You believe in yourself.
</br>
I don't know how many times I have been tested with this question. I was wrote off, looked down, and labelled as unrealistic.
I wake up every morning and confront the hard truth that nobody knows or understands where I'm going except me. 
And it's on me, and only me, to get there. Once I start achieving things and proving people wrong,
the hardest lesson I had to learn was to not walk around with a chip on your shoulder.
Accomplishing something on your own is the easy part. The hard part is sharing the prize with all the people (especially those closest to you — family, friends, etc.) 
that didn't believe in you when you needed it most or had constantly dismissed my aspirations.
That's when you begin to accept and understand that sometimes nobody sees your vision except you.

</br>
I have won 2nd place in my School's National badminton doubles when no one believed I was good enough.
</br>
Made a career switch to IT when I was told by numerous people that I cannot learn "everything IT" as I did not have the background and was too old to start any programming language.
</br>
Started a business and made tens of thousands of profit even though everyone was telling me to give up.
 </br>
 The list goes on...
 </br>
 </br>
 What do you when no one believes in you?
 </br>
  </br>
 You believe in yourself.
 </br>
 </br>
Not Everyone Is Meant To See Your Vision.
